# Gamified-Quiz
## About

Basic online quiz built to dynamically add questions to the DOM based on an array of question objects.

I tried to build this to be as flexible as it can be (within a short time-frame) without having to hardcode the questions in HTML. To add further questions in the future, just add more question objects into the questions array and the browser will handle the rest!

## Design / Layout

I tried to keep the design and layout as simple and minimal as possible. I've also built it so that it is responsive to match Quire's existing website, but adding a few minor adjustments to create more subtlety when it comes to Quire's green.
